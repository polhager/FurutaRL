# FurutaRL

This package contains a model of the Furuta pendulum, as well as other code that was used in my Master thesis "Robust Reinforcement Learning Control of a Furuta Pendulum". src contains the necessary package files, notebooks contains the runnable code I used. The notebooks are very disorganized.
